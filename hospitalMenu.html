	<div id="demo2" class="collapse">
		<p>When interviewing for a hospital pharmacy job researching the trust should be your first step. What can you find out about the hospital? Do they have many specialist pharmacist posts? Has the trust or department won any awards recently? The more you know about the trust the more easily you will be able to answer the "Why this trust?" question.</p>
		<p>Does the trust have any values or objectives/mission statments? It is common for interviewers to ask for an example of a time you have met their values "When have you demonstrated excellent patient care?"</p>
		<p>Make sure you prepare several example scenarios which could potentially for several questions. Examples include times you made an intervention, solved a problem etc.</p>
		<p>For a general rotational pharmacist post you are likely to have to undertake a clinical excercise e.g. clinically checking a prescription. Generally this wont be too hard and should be easy enough for any pharmacist. </p>
		<p>If the post is more specialised then expect to be asked questions which focus on the chosen area. This doesn't necessarily mean clinical questions however. For example for antimicrobial pharmacist job you might be asked about antibiotic CQUIN targets.</p>
